# :hearts: BlackJack :spades:

The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy. If you can count cards it is one of the only casino games that is in the players favour.

But even for the casual participant who plays a reasonably good game, Blackjack is one of the most attractive casino games from an odds perspective.

This version of Blackjack has a card counting feature that allows you to practice your card counting skills. It also employs an insurance system if that dealer has Ace up on the flop - so you can incoproate that in to your practice as well.

## Object of the Game

The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

If you run out of money you lose.

## Turn structure

1. Player places bet by clicking chips
2. Player starts the hand by pressing Deal
3. Player can choose to hit as long as they are below 21
4. When player is done hitting they can hit press stand to end their turn
5. Dealer will then stay if over 16 or hit until they reach above 16.
6. Whoever comes closer to 21 without going over wins. If both dealer and player have the same hand value it is a push/draw.

## Betting Rules

- Players start with an initial 1000 in their bank.
- A bet cannot go above the player bank total
- If the dealer has an Ace up after the initial deal players have the option to pay insurance, which costs one half the bet value.
- If the player has insurance and the dealer has blackjack, player gets 2x insurance back.
- The result of winning is 2x your bet
- The result of a push is getting your bet back.

# :clubs: WAR :diamonds:

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a face down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up. The winner of the war takes all the cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck.

If the face-up cards are again equal then the war repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

## Object of the Game

The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

## Turn structure

1. Click the deck

## Built With :hearts:
