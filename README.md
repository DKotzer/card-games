<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

For my first project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a collection of card games. I will start with War, Blackjack and Poker. After the boot camp I could potentially come back and add more games to the home page.

I sort of made War by mistake before actually starting the git so I am going to simulate some of the stages of how I made it with the next few commits. Also this readme is a template that I am trying out for the first time so it might look wierd.
