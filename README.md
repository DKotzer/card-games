<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

For my first project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a collection of card games. I will start with War, Blackjack and Poker. After the boot camp I could potentially come back and add more games to the home page.

Oops after looking up the average number of turns for a game of war I realized that two equal cards isnt a draw but a 'war'.

## Lessons Learned

- watch out for single = when checking if something is equal to something else. Check for this early on when troubleshooting
- it took me a while to figure out why some cards kept dissapearing from the decks.
