<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## General Overview

Card Games is a collection of card games.
You select which game you would like to play on the home page by clicking it. Currently there is only War and Blackjack.

You can play the game by clicking [here].

## BlackJack

The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy. If you can count cards it is one of the only casino games that is in the players favour.

But even for the casual participant who plays a reasonably good game, Blackjack is one of the most attractive casino games from an odds perspective.

This version of Blackjack has a card counting feature that allows you to practice your card counting skills. It also employs an insurance system if that dealer has Ace up on the flop - so you can incoproate that in to your practice as well.

### Object of the Game

The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

## Turn structure

1. Player places bet by clicking chips
2. Player starts the hand by pressing Deal
3. Player can choose to hit as long as they are below 21
4. When player is done hitting they can hit press stand to end their turn
5. Dealer will

## WAR

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

### Object of the Game

The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

## About The Project

For my first project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a collection of card games. I will start with War, and Blackjack. After the boot camp I could potentially come back and add more games to the home page.

### Installation

If you prefer to install the game on your machine for offline play you can clone the repo using the below code in your terminal of choice:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:DKotzer/card-games.git
```

## Lessons Learned

- watch out for single = when checking if something is equal to something else. Check for this early on when troubleshooting
- it took me a while to figure out why some cards kept dissapearing from the decks.
